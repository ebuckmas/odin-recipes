        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a pizza recipe I found on allrecipes.com.</p>
        <p>Pizza is probaby my favorite food. I actually make a pretty mean cast iron pepperoni pizza.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Dough</li>
                <li>Sauce</li>
                <li>Cheese</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
                <li>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture. Knead dough until smooth, about 7 minutes.</li>
                <li>Grease a large bowl lightly with olive oil. Form dough into a tight ball and lightly grease the top. Place in the bowl; cover loosely with plastic wrap. Let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Mix crushed tomatoes and pizza sauce together in a bowl to make sauce.</li>
                <li>Grease a heavy-gauge rimmed 12x17-inch baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle remaining olive oil over pizza.</li>
                <li>Let pizza rise in a warm area until puffy, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Bake pizza on the center rack of the preheated oven until edges are very dark brown but top is not burnt, 15 to 20 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes before slicing into squares.</li>
            </ol>
